# The project should contain a simple function to calculate whether or not 
# a year is a leap year. Use control flow, and provide some examples of how the function 
# works in the main.R. The function should behave as follows:

source("R/leapyear.R")

is.leap(1581)
is.leap(2000)
is.leap(2002)
is.leap('john')
